	<!-- <h2>Version 2.0</h2>
	The most important changes in 2.0:
	<ul>
	<li><strong>Sets are now versioned</strong> - you don't have to upload every iteration as a new set. The "set" is now a sequence of versions of the card file. You can see history of a set or even history of individual cards on their respective pages.</li> 
	<li><strong>Beautiful set pages</strong> - you can now craft a beautiful and representative home page for your set using powerful content formatting tools. There is now also an autocard feature, which enables you to link card or card images from your set page dynamically, using only a card name.</li>
	<li><strong>Revamped set uploading</strong> - set upload now takes few more steps, but it offers you much more feedback throughout. Any errors in the import file will be reported to you and the upload tool will even check availability of all the card images and generate a nice version-to-version change log!</li>
	<li><strong>Improved event hosting and drafting</strong> - It is now much less tedious to host events and the drafting experience is now also better than ever before.</li>
	</ul> -->
